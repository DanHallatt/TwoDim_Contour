# TwoDim_Contour
Plots a series of 2-dimensional data in the form of a contour map. Contours are based on 'spatial'-density of datapoints in the domain of the ternary plot.

<!-- Options -->

 User can specify the following parameters when calling the function:
 - colour of the colour gradient, according to cmap available options (https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html).

 - yData = [x1, x2, ... xn] where x = Mg# = Mg / (Mg + Fe) in at.%.
 - xMax = 0.6
 - xMin = 0.1
 - yMax = 1.0
 - yMin = 0.6
 - ContLines = 'y'
